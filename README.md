The side bar has all the menu buttons that you need. The highlihgt system highlighst the keys that need to be typed, and only allow for those to be typed. The guided highlights one by one, the necesary does all the keys, and none does none of them. The level system is 1 being easy, 2 is medium, 3 is hard, and 4 is for private information that can be added with the add word button.

The add word works by typing a word into the box and hitting add word. You may need to refresh but it will work. To clear, hit the clear button and reload.

The Interiors:

Like said above, you can access the code from there or running the HTML file. There are 3 files, HTML which has most of the basic stuff. Then the JavaScript, which has all of the methods and defines what buttons do what, It also updates the words. Then the CSS which makes everything look nice. 

The code is complicated. Even we get lost in it sometimes. The CSS is basic, the HTML is split up into parts, the bottom section is more of the side bar whereas the top is more keyboard. The JavaScript is all over the place. I suggest you read the headers to understand what is going on there.
